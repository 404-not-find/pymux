CHANGELOG
=========

0.10: 2016-05-05
----------------

Upgrade to prompt_toolkit 1.0.0

New features:
- Added 'C-b PPage' key binding (like tmux).
- Many performance improvements in the vt100 parser.

Improvements/fixes:
- Don't crash when decoding utf-8 input fails. (Sometimes it happens when using
  the mouse in lxterminal.)
- Cleanup CLI object when the client was detached. (The server would become
  very slow if the CLI was not removed for a couple of times.)
- Replace errors when decoding utf-8 input.
- Fixes regarding multiwidth characters.
- Bugfix: Don't use 'del' on a defaultdict, but use pop(..., None) instead, in
  order to avoid key errors.
- Handle decomposed unicode characters correctly.
- Bugfix regarding the handling of 'clear'.
- Fixes a bug where the cursor stays at the top.
- Fix: The socket in the pymux client should be blocking.
